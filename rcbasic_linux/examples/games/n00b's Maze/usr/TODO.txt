TODO
----------------------------------------------------
1. Collision Detection  (Due Date: 3-14)
	* NOTE: Will probably need to implement atleast 2 different shapes: Axis Aligned Boxes and Spheres

2. Single Texture System (Due Date: 3-15)

3. Animation System (Due Date: 3-18)
	* Break down animation frames into separate obj files
	* Implement actor_source swapping on frame change timer
	* Implement texture swapping for Sprite2D and Sprite3D

4. Build Custom Level Editor (Due Date: 3-26)
	* Basic UI Layout (Due Date: 3-19)

	TOP BAR (Due Date: 3-19)
	----------------------------------------------------
	* New Level
		* Level Name
	* Load Level
	* Save Level
		* Automatically saves everything from other tabs

	TEXTURE TAB (Due Date: 3-19)
	----------------------------------------------------
	* Import textures
	* Texture Viewer

	MESH TAB (Due Date: 3-21)
	----------------------------------------------------
	* Save Mesh Data (texture, collision)
	* Import obj files
	* Applying texture to mesh
	* Add a collision mesh to a mesh
	* implement a similar bounding box system to n00b engine


	ANIMATION TAB (Due Date: 3-23)
	----------------------------------------------------
	* New Animation
	* Save Animation
	* Delete Animation
	* Animated texture system (probably similiar to animated tiles in n00b engine)
	* Animated Mesh System
		* similar to sprite animation in n00b engine
		* instead of picking from a tile screen for each frame, it should probably just select from a list

	
	SCENE TAB (Due Date: 3-26)
	----------------------------------------------------
	* First Person controls for navigating the scene
	* View as Wireframe or Texture (I might just have a default wire frame texture to do this)
	* Selection and Placement Modes
	* Placing objects
		* Enable Snapping ( Set a translation, rotation, and scale snap value)
		* Multi Select (hold shift and click)
			* Set a specific property for all selected objects
		* Box Select
		* New Actor should be created on placement
		* Selected object should get a modifier cursor (translate, rotate, or scale)
		* Translate cursor should translate when clicking on a axis and holding the mouse and moving it
		* Rotate cursor should rotate when clicking on a axis and holding the mouse and moving it
		* Scale is uniform so the scale will increase when clicking and holding the mouse and moving it
	* Set object as terrain
	* Object Properties Window
		* Name
		* Type
		* Position
		* Rotation
		* Scale
		* Enable Collision
			* Use Collision Mesh
		* Mesh
			* Mesh Properties
		* Animation (window with a listbox for easier searching)
	* Background Window (Max of 4 layers)
		* Layer 1 Texture
		* Layer 2 Texture
		* Layer 3 Texture
		* Layer 4 Texture
		* Plain Texture
	* Mesh Selection Tab
		* Select Mesh from list for placement in scene
