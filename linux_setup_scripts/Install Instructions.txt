There is a geany file included for getting syntax support in the geany editor.

If you want to use geany as your editor (recommended), follow these steps.
	1. Install geany

	2. Open geany and then close it. (Geany doesn't make its config directory until you open it atleast once.)

	3. Run rcbasic_geany_config.sh to configure geany to use RCBasic (this will override the freebasic config file so if you are using freebasic with geany you might not want to do this).


If you want to port to android you will need to install jdk 11 or greater and download the android sdk from google. 
Once you have downloaded it you will need to set your ANDROID_HOME and ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variables and then run init_android_sdk.sh.

The following is an example of how ANDROID_HOME and ANDROID_SDK_ROOT should look:

	export ANDROID_HOME=/home/user/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest
	export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME

Note: To edit environment variables permanently you can set them in your .bashrc file located in your
home folder



It is also recommended that you install these packages if you want to use the distribute tool:

	cmake
	python3
	nodejs
