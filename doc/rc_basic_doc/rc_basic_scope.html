    </span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope refers to where you are able to access a
    variable.&nbsp; Basically variables cannot be accessed from outside the
    scope they are created in.&nbsp; Look at the following:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="code">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = <span class="number">5</span><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="keyword">While</span> A &lt; <span class="number">10</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B = <span class="number">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    '-----&nbsp; B is created inside this loop and cannot be accessed outside of
    this loop<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = A + <span class="number">1</span>&nbsp; '----- A was created
    before this loop started so it will be able to be used after this loop ends<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="keyword">Wend</span><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="keyword">Print</span> B<br>
    </span>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above program WILL NOT COMPILE.&nbsp; That is because
    the variable B was created inside the scope of the WHILE loop and nothing
    outside the WHILE loop will be able to access it.&nbsp; The variable A was
    created outside the WHILE loop so the variable A could be used anywhere in
    this example.&nbsp; So a variable can go into a deeper scope than where it
    was created but it cannot go to a lesser scope than where it was
    created.&nbsp; A scope deepens every time a new block is started.&nbsp;
    Blocks refer to the code within a loop, within a Function, or within a Sub
    Routine.
