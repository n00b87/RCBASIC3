<br>
This 
tutorial will assume you have read part 1 and atleast attempted the 
challenges I presented at the end.&nbsp; If you have ever dealt with a 
programming language before you were probably able to finish the 
challenges without too much trouble.&nbsp; However since this is an 
introduction to programming I am going to assume you were not able to 
complete the challenges or had a very difficult time doing so.&nbsp; You 
might be thinking to yourself, if simple programs like these are this 
challenging to write then I will definitely never learn to program stuff
 like games or any other kind of software that people could actually 
use.&nbsp; Believe it or not, <span class="T2">EVERY</span> programmer 
started off not knowing what a variable is or how to use a function.&nbsp; So
 lets break these challenges down and understand how to get them to 
work.<br>
<br>
The first challenge was to have the user enter a number and
 then output every number between 1 and the number the user enters.&nbsp; If 
you remember from the last tutorial I introduced the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$( )</span> function.
 The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$( )</span> function looks like this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Input$ ( <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Prompt Text"</span> )</span>&nbsp; '----- This will write the Prompt Text to the console and then wait for the user to type something in.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
So to get a number from the user we could just do this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Input$ ( <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span> )</span> '----- This will ask the user to enter a number and then wait for the user to type something in.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
However
 there is three problems with this line the way it is.&nbsp; The first 
problem is: how will we know what number the user entered later on in 
our program?&nbsp; The solution to this problem is we have to store that 
number in a variable.&nbsp; If you remember from part 1, a variable is a 
symbol such as a letter, word, or group of letters and numbers that we 
can use to represent a value.&nbsp; There are two types of variables: numbers
 and strings.&nbsp; Number variables hold numbers and can be used anywhere in
 your program to do math.&nbsp; String variables can hold any kind of text 
including numbers, however, <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">NUMBERS STORED IN STRING VARIABLES CANNOT BE USED TO DO MATH</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>&nbsp;
 Now that we know we need to store the number in a variable we get to 
the second problem.&nbsp; The Input$( ) function is a string function so we 
can only store the value in a string variable.&nbsp; However, if we are going
 to count from 1 to the number the user entered we will need to be able 
to do math with the variable.&nbsp; Fortunately RC Basic has functions built 
in to convert between numbers and strings. So we can solve this problem 
by doing the following.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_input$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>)</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_number = Val(user_input$)</span><br></span><br>
Lets break the code above down by each line.<br>
<br>
First we ask the user to enter a number and store the number in a string variable we create called user_input$.<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_input$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>)</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">
<br>
<br>
Next
 we use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Val( )</span> function to convert the text stored in the 
user_input$ string variable to its number value and we store this number
 in a number variable we create called user_number.<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_number = Val(user_input$)</span></span><br>
<br>
The
 third problem is not really a problem right now but it will be by the 
time we finish the program.&nbsp; But for now we have a number from the user 
that we can use to do math so lets continue. To be able to count from 1 
to the number we need a loop.&nbsp; The simplest way to accomplish this is 
with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> loop.&nbsp; I covered the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> loop in the last tutorial but I 
will give a brief overview of how the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> loop works here.&nbsp; Look at the 
following<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">For</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3"><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">variable</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"> &nbsp;</span> =&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">initial_value</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">To</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" class="T3">final_value</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">Step</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3"><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">increase_amount</span><br>...Code To Loop....<br></span><span class="T2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next</span><br><br></span>The
 start of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> loop has a variable which is set to the initial value 
after "=". Then the keyword <span style="font-weight: bold;">TO</span> is entered following the initial value.&nbsp; 
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> keyword is optional. Without <span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> the variable is automatically
 increased by 1 each time through the loop. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> is used, you must 
enter an amount you want to increase the variable by each time through 
the loop. For the purpose of our program we could just do the following 
for now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">For n = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> to user_number</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Print n</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Next</span><br></span><br>
The
 code above sets the variable n to 1 and will loop the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRINT</span> command 
between the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">NEXT</span> lines increasing n by 1 each time through the 
loop until n is equal to user_number.&nbsp; So the program we have looks like
 this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_input$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>)</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">user_number = Val(user_input$)</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">For n = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> to user_number</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Print n</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Next</span><br></span><br>
Run
 this program and type a few numbers in.&nbsp; It should do what the 
challenge wanted it to do.&nbsp; But remember the third problem I mentioned.&nbsp;
 Well it is still in our program.&nbsp; To demonstrate what I mean, run the 
program and type in a number less than 1.&nbsp; You should see the program 
continuously counting.&nbsp; So what is the problem?&nbsp; Well if you remember 
earlier when I was talking about the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> loop I mentioned that without 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> the variable will automatically increase by 1.&nbsp; So if user_number 
is less than what n is initially set to, n will never pass the number 
and will just keep counting too infinity. The solution to this final 
problem is to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> keyword to increase the variable n by 1 if 
the user enters a number greater than or equal to 1 and decrease n by 1 
if the user enters a number less than 1.&nbsp; To do this we will need to use
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IF</span> block. Lets review the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IF</span> block again real quick.&nbsp; Look at the 
following.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">If</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 102);" class="T3">condition</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">Then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">--- If the condition is true then the following code will be executed</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">...code to execute...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">ElseIf</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">condition</span> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">Then</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- If the previous conditions were not true and this condition is then the following code is executed</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">...code to execute...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">Else</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--- If none of the other conditions were true then the following code
is executed</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T3">...code to execute...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">End</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span class="T2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If</span><br><br></span>To
 use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">IF</span> block with to determine whether to set <span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> to 1 or -1 we 
simply need to make one more variable.&nbsp; Lets call this variable 
increase.&nbsp; So if user_number is greater than or equal to 1 then we will 
set increase to 1 and if user_number is less than one then we will set 
increase to -1.&nbsp; Here is how it looks.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">
<span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>
If user_number &gt;= <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> Then</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>
Else</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">-1</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>
End If</span><br></span><br>
In
 the above code we create a variable called increase and set it to 1.&nbsp; 
If the users number greater than or equal to 1 then increase will remain
 1.&nbsp; If the users number is not greater than or equal to 1 then the 
increase variable will be set to -1.<br>
<br>
Now we just need to add the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">STEP</span> keyword to our <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> block to use the increase variable to count up 
or down depending on what number the user types in.&nbsp; The new <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> line 
will look like this.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">For n = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> To user_number Step increase</span><br>
<br>
So the final program will look like the the program below.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">user_input$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>)<br>user_number = Val(user_input$)<br><br>increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span><br><br>If user_number &gt;= <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> Then<br>increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span><br>
<br>Else<br>increase = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">-1</span><br><br>
End If<br><br>For n = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> To user_number Step increase<br>Print n<br>Next</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">
Try the program out with different numbers and see if you get the right output.<br>
<br>
<br>
The
 second challenge was to write a program that continues to ask the User 
for there name until they enter "Bob". Then tell the User "Good bye 
Bob". This program will actually be much easier as we do not have to 
convert the text we get from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$( )</span> function to a number.&nbsp; The 
biggest difference between this challenge and the first challenge is 
that we will be continuously getting input from the user until the user 
enters "Bob".&nbsp; Since we need to keep getting input from the user we will
 be getting the user input inside the loop this time.&nbsp; But we will 
create the variable we will be storing the users input in before we 
start the loop.&nbsp; Since we are not looping a certain number of times like
 in the last example we will use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHILE</span> loop.&nbsp; Our basic setup for 
this program is below.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">user_name$ = <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">""</span><br><br>While user_name$ &lt;&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Bob"</span><br><br>Wend<br></span><br>
In
 the above code we first create a string variable called user_name$ and 
store an empty string in it.&nbsp; We will be using this variable to store 
input from the user inside the loop but for right now we just want it to
 be empty.&nbsp; Next we start a <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHILE</span> loop.&nbsp; The <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHILE</span> loop will loop while 
the variable user_name$ is not equal to "Bob" (the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">&lt;&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span> operator test whether two values are <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">NOT EQUAL</span>).
 The <span style="font-weight: bold;">WEND</span> keyword is simply telling the computer to jump back to the 
start of the loop and test if user_name$ is not equal to "Bob". If they 
are not equal it will repeat the code in the loop.&nbsp; So now we just need 
to write the code we want to repeat.&nbsp; The only thing we need to repeat 
is asking the user for there name and storing there name in the 
user_name$ variable.&nbsp; Just like in the last challenge we will use the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$( )</span> function.&nbsp; So our code inside our loop will look like this.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">user_name$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name? "</span>)</span><br style="font-family: FreeMono;">
<br>
Lastly we want to say "Good Bye Bob" if the user enters "Bob".&nbsp; For this all we need is a simple <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRINT</span> statement.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Good Bye Bob"</span></span><br>
<br>
So the final program will look like this.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">user_name$ = <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">""</span><br><br>While user_name$ &lt;&gt; <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Bob"</span><br>user_name$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name? "</span>)<br>Wend<br><br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Good Bye Bob"</span></span>

<p>
And now for some challenges.<br>

<br>1. Write a program that ask the user for 5 numbers and gives the average of the numbers they enter.
<br>
<br>2. Write a simple multiple choice trivia game. Give the user atleast 3 questions and 3 choices per question.
<br>
<br>3. Improve the second challenge from the last lesson to not be case sensitive.
