<p class="P1"><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Introduction To Programming</span></big></big><br>This
 tutorial is designed to introduce complete newbies to the world of 
computer programming and specifically programming using RC Basic. This 
tutorial will not assume any previous programming knowledge and really 
won't even assume you know much about how a computer works. A basic 
understanding of 6th Grade Algerbra will come in handy but is not 
necessary. Now that I got that out of the way, lets take our first steps
 in our journey to becoming computer programmers.<br><br>First lets go 
over the requirements you will need to follow this tutorial. You will 
need a computer (obviously), RC Basic (yet again obvious, but I had to 
say it), and the will to learn (not essential but it will definitely 
help). Ok lets begin.<br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">What Is A Computer Program?</span></big><br>It
 seems like a stupid question but it is important to understand what a 
program is before we go any further. A computer program is simply a list
 of <span class="T2">detailed</span> instructions telling a computer how to perform a task. And when I say detailed I mean <span class="T2">DETAILED</span>.
 A computer can perform several complex equations a second but still 
does not know more than you do. If you don't know any complex equations 
neither does the computer. To give the computer our list of instructions
 on what we want it to do we use a computer language. There are probably
 as many computer languages as there are spoken languages and maybe even
 more. A computer programmer chooses a language based on the task they 
need to perform, how complex the task is, the time it takes to write the
 program, and personal choice. For this tutorial we will be using RC 
Basic. RC Basic is based on the BASIC programming language, which was 
designed to be easy to learn and use. RC Basic adds the advantage of 
modern multimedia features and the ability to write our program once and
 run it on multiple operating systems.<br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Our First Program</span></big><br>Lets
 start off with a simple computer program. We are going to make a 
program that writes the words "Hello World" to the screen. To tell the 
computer to write some text to the screen we will use the <span class="T2">Print</span> command. Type the following into the RC Basic Editor and click the <span class="T2">Run</span> button (the triangle button or you could go into the build menu and click Run).<br><br><span style="font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">"Hello World"</span></span><br><br>You
 should see "Hello World" in your console (the black DOS screen). 
Congratulations, you just wrote your first computer program. So lets 
break this program down into its individual parts. First is the <span class="T2">Print</span>
 command. This is telling the computer to write something to the console
 (I will be referring to the DOS screen as the console for the rest of 
this tutorial). And then we have "Hello World". First of all, why is it 
in quotation marks? The short answer is because it is not a number. We 
will go over this more in depth later but for now that is all we need to
 know for right now? Before we move on, use the Print command to write 
some other stuff to the screen.<br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Data Types</span></big><br>We
 are finally going to learn why "Hello World" has quotations around it. 
So lets talk about data types. A data type is simply the type of data 
you are working with. RC Basic has 2 data types: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Numbers</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Strings</span>. 
Numbers are exactly what you think they are. So what are strings? Well 
to answer this we have to understand what a character is. A character is
 a number which is generally represented by some kind of symbol. I know 
that doesn't make since right now so just think of a character as any 
key on your keyboard. The A Key, B Key, and even the SPACE Key are only 
numbers to the computer. When the computer reads a character it is 
actually reading a number and then it outputs a symbol (like letters, 
digits, parenthesis, space, etc.). So what then is a string? Well a 
string is a group of characters strung together (which is why it is 
called a string). RC Basic uses quotation marks to group characters 
together into a string. So in the string "Hello World", H is a 
character, e is a character, and so on. If you want to use a single 
character you would still use quotation marks but you would only have 
one character between the quotation marks.<br><br>Look at the following examples.<br><br><span style="font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">"42"</span><br><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">42</span></span><br><br>The
 first line is a string and the second line is a number. Are you 
confused yet? The first line has the character "4" and the character "2"
 in a string and the second line is the number 42. Yes they look the 
same but the way you perform operations on a string is different than 
the way you perform operations on numbers. It will make more since with 
the examples below.<br><br>This will add the string "53" to the end of the string "42" and output 4253 to the console. Try it.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">"42" <span style="color: black;">+</span> "53"</span></span><br><br>This will will add the number 42 to the number 53 and output 95 to the console. Try it.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">42</span> + <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">53</span></span><br><br>The
 differences between numbers and strings should be starting to clear up a
 little by now. If you are still a little confused at this point don't 
worry. This is only an Introduction to programming. If you are able to 
write some text on the screen and do some simple math by the end of this
 tutorial you will be ready to continue into the next lesson.<br><br>Now
 we are going to get into operators. I know I said at the beginning of 
the tutorial I did not expect you to know much but I am assuming you 
know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. We got a brief 
introduction to the "<span class="T2">+</span>" operator in the last example. It is important to note that the "<span class="T2">+</span>" operator is the only operator that works on both numbers and strings.<br><br>Here is a list of the main string operators.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">+</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Adds one string to the end of another. This example will output "batman" to the console.</p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"bat"</span> + <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"man"</span></span><br></p>
<p class="P1"><span class="T5">Before we continue, lets break down the </span><span class="T3">PRINT</span><span class="T6">
 statement. &nbsp;It is the simplest way to get text on the screen. &nbsp;PRINT 
also allows us to output multiple items of different types by separating
 them with a &#8220;;&#8221;.</span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-family: FreeMono;" class="T6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Text&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">; <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5</span>+<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4</span>; </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">&#8220; More Text&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">;</span>&nbsp; <br>
</span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-family: FreeMono;" class="T6">&#8216;Ending Print with a &#8220;;&#8221; keeps the cursor on the same line in the console.</span><br><br><br>Here is a list of the main number operators.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">+</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Adds two numbers together. This example will output 8 to the console.<br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> + <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">-</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Subtracts one number from another. This example will output 4 to the console.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> - <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">*</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Multiplies two numbers (Note: Multiplication uses an * instead of an x). This example will output 12 to the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> * <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">/</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Divides one number by another. This example will output 3 to the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> / <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">^</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>: Raises a number to a power. This example will output 36 (6 to the second power) to the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> ^ <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br><br>Both
 string operators perform the same operation. They will place the 
characters in the second string at the end of the first string. The 
number operators perform the same operations they do on a calculator. 
One more important thing to mention is that the number operators follow 
the Order of Operations. Take a look at the example below.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4</span>+<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">3</span>*<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br>In
 the example above the, following the order of operations PEMDAS 
(Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and 
Subtraction); 3 is multiplied by 2 which is 6, and then 4 is added to it
 which is 10. So math is not necessarily done from left to right but it 
is determined by the order of operations. There is more to the order of 
operations but we are not going to cover that right now. We covered all 
of the main operators so before we move on lets look at one more example
 that uses parenthesis.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print (<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4</span>+<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">3</span>)*<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span></span><br><br>This
 is almost the same problem as the example before it, but now it groups 4
 plus 3 together using parenthesis which means 4 and 3 are added first 
which will be 7. Then that 7 is multiplied by 2 which is 14. If you do 
the same problems on a calculator you will get the same answers. Try out
 a few math problems on your own.<br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Interacting With The User</span></big><br>Up
 to this point, we have been writing output to the screen. We have been 
the user as well as the programmer so there was no reason to need to 
accept input from the screen. But when you write programs that are meant
 to be used by people other than yourself you will want to get input 
from the user and process that input to perform some task. So lets dive 
into some code. For this example we are using the function <span class="T2">Input</span>
 to ask the user "What is your name? " and read what the user types into
 the console (which should be there name but they can type whatever they
 want).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name? "</span>)</span><br><br>You
 should have seen "What is your name?" and then been able to type 
something in. You have just received input from the user for the first 
time. So lets break this line down. First we have the function name <span class="T2">Input$</span>.
 Input$ is a built-in function that prompts the user with something and 
it returns what the user typed. This is the first time I used the word 
returns so let me clarify. In the example above lets say you type in Bob
 for your name. The whole Input$() function call is replaced with "Bob".
 Take a look at this example.<br><br>This line does not prompt anything and just waits for you to type something. We are going to type Bob.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Input$(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">""</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">)</span> </span><br><br>After you enter "Bob" the line above will be replaced with "Bob" and the line will finish processing your commands.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">"Bob"</span><br><br>You
 are probably thinking that is useless. What can we do with a line that 
just has a string on it. And the answer is you really can't do anything 
with a line that just has Bob on it. But if we store the string "Bob" we
 can use it to do other stuff with.<br><br>To store "Bob" (or whatever 
you call yourself) we use something called a variable. You might have 
seen variables used in math class in school. A variable is just a symbol
 that holds data. By symbol I don't mean a logo or anything. Just take a
 look at this example.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">a = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span><br>b$ = <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Bob"</span><br>batman = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4.5</span><br>superman$ = <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"this is just random text"</span></span><br><br>This example makes four variables: a, b$, batman, superman$ and stores some data in them. Lets do a break down.<br><br>We
 will start with the variables a and batman. The variables are just 
storing numbers. We can use variables that store numbers when we have 
programs that are going to be handling values that change over time. For
 now lets just do some simple math. Type the variables from the previous
 example and add the following code and run it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print a + batman</span><br><br>This
 example just adds the values in the variables together and outputs the 
values to the screen. You can change the value of a variable at any 
time. This is better explained with another example.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">a = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5</span><br>Print a<br>a = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span><br>Print a<br>a = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5</span> + <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span><br>Print a</span><br><br>What
 we are doing in the example above is changing the value of a and doing 
math and storing the value in a. We can also store the value of one 
variable inside another. Lets Look at another example.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">a = batman<br>Print a<br>a = a + batman<br>Print a</span><br><br>The
 example above will first store the value of batman in the variable a. 
It will write a to the screen. Then it will add a and batman and store 
the result in a and write that value to the screen. <br><br>Now we are 
going to take a look at the other two variables we created: the variable
 b$ and the variable superman$. Did you notice that both of the 
variables end in a $. There is a reason for that. The $ at the end of 
the variable name lets the compiler know that these variables are 
strings. Since these two variables are strings the rules about strings 
apply to these variables. Look at the following examples.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print b$<br>Print superman$<br>Print b$ + superman$</span><br><br>The
 above example writes the value stored in b$ to the screen. Then it 
writes the value stored in superman$ to the screen. Finally it adds the 
contents of the superman$ variable to the end of the contents for the b$
 variable and writes that to the screen.<br><br>Now that we have covered
 variables, how do we use them with the users input. Well lets look at 
the Input$() function again. Notice that the function ends in a $. 
input$() returns a string so it can be used anywhere a string can. Look 
at this example.<br><br>This line does the same thing as the last time 
we used the Input$() function. The main Difference is now we are storing
 the value the user enters into the variable name.</p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">name$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name?"</span>)</span><br><br>This
 code will store "Bob" or what ever you typed in into the variable 
name$. Now we can use the name$ as many times as we want anywhere in our
 program. So now lets make a program that Uses <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$()</span> along with 
Print. We are going to ask the User for there name and then welcome the 
User to RC Basic.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">name$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name? "</span>)<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Hello "</span> + name$ + <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">". Welcome to RC Basic."</span></span></p>
<p class="P1">Lets
 do our break down again. In the first$ line we create a variable called
 name$ and call Input$() in it. This will write "What is your name? " to
 the screen. When the User Enters something, whatever the User types in 
will replace Input$(). So name$ will be whatever the User types in. On 
the next line we use Print to write a message to the screen. The only 
thing different this time is we are adding a variable to our string in 
Input$(). But remember that our variable is a string and can do anything
 a string can, so all you are doing is saying "Hello " + the User's name
 + ". Welcome to RC Basic.".<br><br>We have covered a lot in these first
 few sections so I am going to take this time to challenge you. Write a 
program that ask the User to type there favorite color in and then tell 
them what there favorite color is on the next line.<br><br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Flow Control</span></big><br>Flow
 control sounds like some really complicated topic. But it will probably
 make sense almost immediately. So what is flow control? Simply put, 
flow control is controlling what your program does based on what 
conditions are met. To control the flow in our programs we will use the <span class="T2">If</span>
 statement. The If statement will allow us to execute a block of code 
depending on what conditions are met. Let look at the last example from 
the last segment.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">name$ = Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"What is your name? "</span>)<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Hello "</span> + name$ + <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">". Welcome to RC Basic."</span></span><br><br>To
 give an idea of how to use the If statement we are going to extend this
 program. So lets make the program give a special greeting if Bob is 
typed in for the name. Look at the following example.<br><br><span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">name$ = Input$(</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">"What is your name? "</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">)</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">Print </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">"Hello "</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"> + name$ + </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">". Welcome to RC Basic."</span><br><br><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;">If name$ = </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;">"Bob"</span><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;"> Then</span><br style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;">Print </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;">"We have been expecting you"</span><br style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: FreeMono; font-weight: bold;">End If</span></span><br><br>This
 program will do the same thing it did in the last segment but it adds 
the use of the If statement. So lets do a quick break down.<br><br>This 
line is saying if name$ has "Bob" stored in it, then run the following 
code. Each If statement must end with the Then statement.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If name$ = <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Bob"</span> Then</span><br><br>This line is writing "We have been expecting you" to the screen.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"We have been expecting you"</span></span><br><br>This
 line is ending the block of code that the If statement wanted the 
program to execute and continues the rest of your program.<br><br>The 
block of code started by the If statement can also be given different 
conditions to check for and execute a different block of code for each 
different condition. We are going to take a break from strings and use 
numbers for our next few examples. We are also going to introduce a few 
new operators. So lets start by making some number variables.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">a = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span><br>b = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">3</span><br>c = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5</span></span><br><br>Now
 that we have some variables we are going to make a program that ask the
 User to enter a number and check if the number is equal to each 
variable and outputs something different for each one. First I need to 
cover one very important topic. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input$()</span> function only takes in a 
string. So even number that are typed in by the User are treated as 
strings. So we need to convert the Users input to a number to be able to
 compare it to another number or do any kind of math with it. To do this
 we will use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Val()</span> function. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Val()</span> function converts a string to
 a number. Look at the following example real quick.<br><br>This example will convert the string "12" to the number 12. <br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="P1"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">x = Val(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"12"</span>)</span><br><br>The
 more programs you write, the more you will get use to converting 
numbers to strings and strings to numbers. So how do we use Val() with 
Input$(). Well remember that Input$() can be used anywhere a string can.
 So instead of putting "12" in Val() like we did in the last example we 
will simply put Input$() inside Val(). Make sure your program has the 
variables a, b, and c we created earlier and add this.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">d = Val( Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>) )</span><br><br>The
 code above is creating a variable called d. Then it uses the Val() 
function to convert the string returned by Input$() into a number. The 
string returned by Input$() is what ever the User types in. Now that we 
have gotten a number from the User lets compare that number to the 
variables we made earlier.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If d = a Then<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"You typed the A value"</span><br></span></p>

 do a break down. This is starting a multi-layered If statement block. 
It should be fairly simple to understand. We are going to go through 
each line and examine what is happening step by step.<br><br>This line 
is starting your If block by comparing d(which is what the User typed

in d is equal to the value stored in b then it will output "That is B"

 we are going to play with a few other operators for numbers only. In 
addition to being able to compare if two numbers are equal we can also 
compare if one number is greater than another, less than another, not 
equal to another, greater than or equal to another, etc. Here is a list 
of comparisons we can do with numbers.<br><br>Given we have two number stored in variables a and b.</p>

</ul>
<p class="Text_20_body"><br><br>Here is a few examples of doing some of these comparisons with a If statement.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If a = b Then<br>'Code to execute<br>End If<br><br>If a &lt; b Then<br>'Code to execute<br>End If<br><br>If a &lt;&gt; b Then<br>'Code to execute<br>End If</span><br><br>These
 other comparisons are pretty straight forward. To try these out we are 
going to make a program that ask the User to enter a number. If the 
number is less than or equal to 10 then "Low" will be output to the 
console. If the number is greater than 10 then we will check if the 
number is greater than 20. If it is then then "High" will be output to 
the console. If neither of these conditions are true then "Mid" will be 
output to the console. First we need to get a number from the User. 
Remember we need to use the Val() function to convert the User's input 
from a string to a number.<br><br>Here is where we take the User's input
 and convert it to a number. The Input$() function will get replaced 
with what the User types in so we simply use the Val() function to 
convert Input$() to a number.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">user_num = Val( Input$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Enter a number: "</span>) )</span><br><br>We
 start our If block by comparing user_num (Our input from the User in 
the previous line) to the number 10. If the user_num variable is less 
than or equal to 10 then we use the Print statement to write "Low" to 
the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If user_num &lt;= <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">10</span> Then<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Low"</span></span><br><br>If
 the previous comparison is false then we compare the user_num variable 
to 20. If user_num is greater than 20 then we will write "High" to the

<p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Source_20_Text"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;">End If</span></span><br><br>The last thing we will cover on flow control is the keywords <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">AND</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">OR</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">XOR</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T2">NOT</span>.
 These 4 keywords are actually operators that can be used for more 
specific comparisons. We will start with the AND operator. The AND 
operator will compare the conditions to its left and its right. If both 
conditions are true the AND operator sets the whole expression as true. I
 already know you didn't understand that explanation so it will probably
 be easier to show you. Just look at this example.<br><br>This code will write "This is true" to the console because 1 is equal to 1 and 4 is greater than 2. Yes it is that simple.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span>=<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> AND <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">4</span>&gt;<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span> Then<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"This is true"</span><br>End If</span><br><br>The
 OR statement will set the whole expression it is being used in if at 
least one of the conditions is true. Here is an example of OR.<br><br>This code will write "This is true" to the console because although 1 is not equal to 2, 5 is less than or equal to 6.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span>=<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span> AND <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">5</span>&lt;<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">6</span> Then<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"This is true"</span><br>End If</span><br><br>The
 XOR statement is like the OR statement with one major difference. With 
XOR, one of the conditions in the expression has to be true and the 
other has to be false. Here is an example of XOR.<br><br>This code will 
write "This is true" to the console because 1 is equal to 1 and 2 is 
equal to 2 ( 2 &lt;&gt; 2 is false because 2=2. Remember <span class="T2">&lt;&gt;</span>
 is the NOT EQUAL operator). Basically one condition in the XOR 
expression has to be true and the other has to be false otherwise the 
whole expression is false. If this is slightly confusing don't worry. In
 my 15+ years of programming experience I have never once used this 
operator.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">If <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span>=<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> XOR <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span> &lt;&gt; <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span> Then<br>Print <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"This is true"</span><br>End If</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>The
 last of these special operators we will cover is NOT. This one will be 
extremely simple to understand. Basically if an expression is true it 
becomes false and if an expression is false it becomes true.<br><br>This
 code will write "This is true" to the screen because the expression 1=3
 is false. The NOT statement reverses the false and makes it true.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>

 go over one more program before we move on to the next segment. We will
 ask the User for a number from 1 to 10. If the User enters 3 or 4 then 
we will write "Good Answer" to the console. If the User enters a number 
greater than 5 and less than 9 (Basically 6, 7, or 8) then we will write
 "Choice numbers" to the console. If the User types in any other number 
then we will write "Maybe next time" to the console.<br><br>Here we are 
asking the User to enter a number from 1 to 10 using the Input$() 
function. Input$() returns a string so we have to store it in a string 
variable.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>

 we convert the string the User entered into a string using the Val() 
function. Note: We are using a string variable inside the Val() function
 instead of using Input$() inside it this time. I am showing it this way
 to get you used to the idea that Val() takes a string. It can be a 
string variable, string function, or just a regular string between 
quotation marks.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">num = Val(user_in$)</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>In
 the first line of this piece of code we are comparing the variable num 
(which is the number the User entered) to the number 3 and we compare 
the variable num to the number 4. If the variable num is equal to the

 block of code compares the variable num to the number 5 and the number 9
 if the previous If condition was false. If num is greater than 5 and 
num is less than 9 then we write "Choice numbers" to the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>

 this last bit of code will write "Maybe next time" to the console if

</span><br>End If</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Function</span></big><br>This
 is going to be fairly short. So what is a function? A function is a 
block of code that is labelled by some kind of name so it can be called 
at any point in a program. I know you are confused again. But you have 
been using two functions several times throughout this tutorial. The 
Input$() function and the Val() function. A function has a return value 
that is either a number or a string. The Input$() function returns a 
string so it can be used anywhere in your program a normal string can be
 used. The Val() function returns a number so it can be used anywhere in
 your program a number can be used. Yes even inside a math problem. Are 
these the only two functions available in RC Basic. Not even close. 
There are over 200 functions available in RC Basic which allows you to 
do various task. Here is how a function is structured.<br><br>function_name
 ( argument1, argument2, ..etc ) - A function can have no arguments or 
several arguments. Arguments in a function can be numbers or strings, it
 just depends on what function you are using. So lets look at a few 
different functions to see how other functions are used.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abs()</span> returns the Absolute value of a number.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Abs( <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">-4</span> )</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date$()</span> returns the current date as a string.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">Date$()</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">UCase$()</span> returns the argument you give it as an all uppercase string.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">UCase$(<span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">"Hello World"</span>)</span><br><br>As
 you can see there are different functions to accomplish different task.
 You can learn more functions by looking in the RC Basic reference 
manual located in the Docs folder in the rcbasic directory.<br><br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="T1">Loops</span></big><br>We
 have finally made it to the last part of this tutorial. We are already 
fairly familiar with most of the core concepts of programming. We are 
finishing this lesson with a brief overview of loops. Loops are exactly 
what you think they are. They are ways of repeating blocks of code in 
your program as much as you need them to. Why would we need to repeat 
parts of our program? Well you will often have a program that you will 
want to continue running until the user is done using it or you will 
want to make a counter of some kind.<br><br>We are going to cover two types of loops. The first one we are going over is the <span class="T2">For</span> loop. For loops are used when you want to cycle through a block of code a set number of times. Lets just dive into the code.<br><br>Type this code into your editor and run it.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">For i = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span> to <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">10</span><br>Print i<br>Next</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;"><br>The
 code in the example above writes the numbers 1 to 10 in the console. 
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">For loop</span> starts with a variable, which in this case is i. We set it 
with an initial value of 1 and tell the computer to loop the code 
between the <span class="T2">For</span> line and the <span class="T2">Next</span>
 line until i is equal to 10. When the Next statement is reached, i is 
increased by 1 and the program goes back to the start of the loop. That 
is how the For loop works in a nutshell. There is some extra control we 
can take over the For loop with the <span class="T2">Step</span> 
statement. With the Step statement we can change the amount the variable
 in the For line increases by. Look at the following example.<br><br>This code will write the even numbers from 2 to 10 to the console.<br><span class="Source_20_Text"></span></p>
<p class="Text_20_body"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">For i = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span> to <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">10</span> Step <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">2</span><br>Print i<br>Next</span><br><br>The last loop we are covering in this tutorial is the <span class="T2">While</span> loop. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">while loop</span> will loop through a block of code while a certain condition is true. Look at the following example.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: FreeMono;" class="Source_20_Text">i = <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span><br>While i &lt;= <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">10</span><br>Print i<br>i = i + <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">1</span><br>Wend</span><br><br>In
 the example above we are doing a little bit more than we have been 
doing up to this point. First we are creating a variable called i. We 
start a While loop that compares i to the number 10. If i is less than 
or equal to 10 then we write the value stored in i to the console. Then 
we get to the line <span class="T4">i = i + 1</span>. This line is 
making i equal to the value stored in i plus 1. Basically we are 
increasing i by 1. The Wend line goes back to the start of the while 
block where it compares i to 10 and if it is less than or equal to 10 it
 repeats the block of code again.</p>

<p>
Now for some challenges.<br>

<br>1. Write a program that ask the User to enter a number. Then create a loop that outputs every number between 1 and the number the user enters to the console.
<br>2. Write a program that continues to ask the User for there name until they enter "Bob". Then tell the User "Good by Bob".
